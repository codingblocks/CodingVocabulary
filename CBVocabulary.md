### **Microservices**

Microservices is an architectural approach to building applications. They are distributed and loosely coupled, so one team’s changes won’t break the entire app.

### **[Functional Decomposition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/947874/what-is-functional-decomposition)**

Breaking down a process into smaller pieces based on functionality

### **[Scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Database_scalability)**

"Scaling Horizontal" / "Scaling Out" Adding more copies of nodes (servers / processes) in order to increase work done at the same time.

"Scaling Vertically" Adding more resources to a single node (like a server) in order to increase throughput

### **CRUD**

Simple operations for Create Read Update Delete

### **Mock Objects**

Simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways used in testing code.
